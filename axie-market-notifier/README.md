# axie-market-notifier

### Description ###
Worked on this in 2021 with [johnnyataisg](https://github.com/johnnyataisg).

He did most of the graphql to fetch data while I designed the program to process the data to compute desired results.

At the time, I did not know how to use github to collaborate. Everything was self-taught.

This program is designed to look for the cheapest axie (NFT) within its criteria set.

A notification would be sent to the user whenever an axie (NFT) would meet the criteria.

### Instructions ###
Install node and run "npm install". Then run "npm run start"

Fill out everything the prompt asks for and leave the terminal running.
